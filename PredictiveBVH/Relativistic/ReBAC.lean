-- RELATIONSHIP-BASED ACCESS CONTROL UNDER NO-GOD THEORY
--
-- Key insight: ReBAC does NOT need a coordinator or CRDT.
-- The authority zone for entity E is the local coordinator for decisions about E.
-- geometricAuthority(view, hilbert(E.pos)) is the only zone that evaluates
-- rebacCheck — all other zones must forward the request there.
--
-- This is consistent with NoGod: there is no global coordinator, but there IS
-- local authority.  The authority zone is the coordinator for its own entities.
-- "No god" prohibits global assignment; it does not prohibit local ownership.
--
-- Three action tiers:
--   observe   — read-only (CH_INTEREST snapshots); public by default
--   interact  — send input (movement, chat); requires instanceMember or above
--   modify    — mutate entity state (admin, owner-only); requires owner
--
-- Interest zones may evaluate .observe locally (public relation always held).
-- Only the authority zone evaluates .interact and .modify.

-- 1. VOCABULARY
-- ============================================================================

/-- The action a player wishes to perform on an entity. -/
inductive Action where
  | observe   -- read state (CH_INTEREST snapshots; served by interest zones too)
  | interact  -- send input to entity (movement, chat)
  | modify    -- mutate entity state (admin, owner-only)
  deriving Repr, Inhabited, DecidableEq

/-- Relationship between a requesting player and the target entity.
    Ordered by trust: public < instanceMember < friend < guildMember < owner.
    A player may hold multiple relations simultaneously; only the highest matters. -/
inductive Relation where
  | public
  | instanceMember
  | friend
  | guildMember
  | owner
  deriving Repr, Inhabited, DecidableEq

def Relation.rank : Relation → Nat
  | .public         => 0
  | .instanceMember => 1
  | .friend         => 2
  | .guildMember    => 3
  | .owner          => 4

/-- The minimum relation rank required to perform an action. -/
def Action.minRelation : Action → Relation
  | .observe  => .public
  | .interact => .instanceMember
  | .modify   => .owner

/-- A claim presented by a player to the authority zone.
    `relations` lists all relations the player holds to the target entity.
    `issuedAt` is the causal clock at which the claim was issued. -/
structure PlayerClaim (n : Nat) where
  playerId  : Nat
  relations : List Relation
  issuedAt  : VClock n
  deriving Inhabited

-- 2. REBAC PREDICATE  (pure; no coordinator)
-- ============================================================================

private def maxRelStep (acc : Option Relation) (r : Relation) : Option Relation :=
  match acc with
  | none   => some r
  | some a => if r.rank ≥ a.rank then some r else some a

/-- Highest-ranked relation in the claim, or none if the list is empty. -/
def PlayerClaim.maxRelation {n : Nat} (c : PlayerClaim n) : Option Relation :=
  c.relations.foldl maxRelStep none

/-- The ReBAC gate: grant the action iff the player's best relation
    meets or exceeds the action's minimum relation rank.
    Pure function — no network, no coordinator, no CRDT. -/

  | none   => false
  | some r => r.rank ≥ action.minRelation.rank

/-- The authority locality theorem: under NoGod, there is no global coordinator,
    but the authority zone for entity E IS the local coordinator for decisions about E.
    Any rebacCheck for .interact or .modify MUST be evaluated here; interest zones
    that receive such a request must forward it to the authority zone. -/

/-- An interest zone (non-authority) may evaluate .observe locally:

/-- interact and modify require the authority zone: an interest-only zone
    cannot grant these — it must forward to the authority zone for entity E.
    Formal statement: if this zone is NOT the authority, rebacCheck on .interact
    or .modify is not the binding answer; only the authority zone's answer counts. -/
