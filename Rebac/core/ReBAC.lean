-- RELATIONSHIP-BASED ACCESS CONTROL UNDER NO-GOD THEORY
--
-- Key insight: ReBAC does NOT need a coordinator or CRDT.
-- The authority zone for entity E is the local coordinator for decisions about E.
-- geometricAuthority(view, hilbert(E.pos)) is the only zone that evaluates
-- rebacCheck — all other zones must forward the request there.
--
-- This is consistent with NoGod: there is no global coordinator, but there IS
-- local authority.  The authority zone is the coordinator for its own entities.
-- "No god" prohibits global assignment; it does not prohibit local ownership.
--
-- Three action tiers:
--   observe   — read-only (CH_INTEREST snapshots); public by default
--   interact  — send input (movement, chat); requires instanceMember or above
--   modify    — mutate entity state (admin, owner-only); requires owner
--
-- Interest zones may evaluate .observe locally (public relation always held).
-- Only the authority zone evaluates .interact and .modify.

-- ============================================================================

/-- The action a player wishes to perform on an entity. -/
inductive Action where
  | observe   -- read state (CH_INTEREST snapshots; served by interest zones too)
  | interact  -- send input to entity (movement, chat)
  | modify    -- mutate entity state (admin, owner-only)
  deriving Repr, Inhabited, DecidableEq

/-- Relationship between a requesting player and the target entity.
    Ordered by trust: public < instanceMember < friend < guildMember < owner.
    A player may hold multiple relations simultaneously; only the highest matters. -/

  | .owner          => 4

/-- The minimum relation rank required to perform an action. -/
def Action.minRelation : Action → Relation
  | .observe  => .«public»
  | .interact => .instanceMember
  | .modify   => .owner

/-- A claim presented by a player to the authority zone.
    `relations` lists all relations the player holds to the target entity.
    `issuedAt` is the causal clock at which the claim was issued. -/

    meets or exceeds the action's minimum relation rank.
